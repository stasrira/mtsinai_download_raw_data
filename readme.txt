======================================================
Application for retrieving RawData from remote web locations
=======================================================

This application runs a script that utilizes other tools. Description of all supporting tools is provided further in this document.

----------------------------------------------
process_requests.sh
----------------------------------------------
The main application script is "process_requests.sh". This script drives whole process and make calls to any other required tool. 

The application is designed to read request files provided in a specific format and run Data Downloader (dl_raw_data.sh) tool 
for each entry in the request file. This Data Downloader is a wrapper around the standard "wget" tool. The expectation that all log files 
are being present in central request location. Path to the directory containing requests is passed through a command line parameter on the start 
of the "process_requests.sh". 

The Request file contains one download requests per line in the file. 
	- Files are expected to be in the Tab-delimited format. 
	- First column of an entry presents a source of the data being downloaded, 
	- The second column presents a local destination directory where data will be stored, 
	- The third column presents the name of the directory (that will be created in the destination directory) where all downloaded data will be put. 
	- The tool will strip any folder structure from the provided source and store the actual data in the destination folder.
	- Upon completion of processing the request, it is being moved to a "processed" folder which is a subfolder being created in the directory storing all requests. 
		- Appropriate permission should be set to allow the application to create such folder.
 
Example of the request file entries:
...............................................
Source	Destination	LocalName

...............................................

During running, Data Downloader creates log files. "logs" folder is a container for all log files. 
	- A separate subfolder starting with a date stamp and reflecting the name of the request will be created for each processed request file.
	- Each such sub-folder will contain 
		- one log file for the request being processed (having words "process_log" in its name) 
		- a separate log file for each "wget" call being made during processing. 

Upon completion of the processing a request, an email could be configured to be sent to a predefined email addresses with summary of processing results. 
Email addresses are currently being set as hardcoded parameters in the "process_requests.sh" script. 

Any parameters required to be set for processing downloads (that are not being passed as command line parameters) are being set in the beginning of the script through a set of variables.

Archiving of the historical log files.
	- Since created log files for "wget" calls can be of a big size all previously created log files are being compacted and archived with the "tar" tool.
	- The "process_log" files are being excluded from archiving due to relatively small size of the files.
	- Archiving is performed with the Log Archiver tool.


Here is help info for in-line argument usage for process_requests.sh:

arguments usage:
        [-v: report the version; if this argument is supplied, it aborts execution of the script]
        [-h: help; if this argument is supplied, it aborts execution of the script]
        [-d: debug version]
        [-f path to folder that will contain Download Request files (of predefined format); this is a required parameter
                Request files have to be a tab-delimited text files.
                Each row of the file contains one download request, where
                        - First argument provides URL to the data to be downloaded.
                        - Second argument specifies path to the location where downloaded data will be saved.
                        - Third argument specifies the folder name that will be created in the given path; all downloaded data will be save in this folder.]
        [-s: pattern that will be used to search for Download Request files in the given folder. '*.tsv' is a default value.]
        [-m: command that will be used to perfomr the download/copy process. If not provided, the data source for each entry in the request file will be analyzed to select the appropriate command.
                - expected values are 'wget' or 'cp'].
----------------------------------------------
start_processing_requests.sh
----------------------------------------------
Start_processing_requests.sh contains a commanline call of the process_requests.sh script. It contains all parameters required to be passed to the process_requests.sh and 
used to simplify calling of the process_requests.sh. If desired, this script can be easily replaced with a direct command line call of the process_requests.sh.

----------------------------------------------
Data Downloader - dl_raw_data.sh (current version 1.01)
----------------------------------------------
This tool is designed to collect all files from the provided web location (except html files).
The tool is a wrapper around wget utility that is used to retrieve files. 
The main purpose is to collect sequencing result files (fastq, etc.) It will recursively go through all sub-folders, 
get all files and download those to a location specified. The tool will not take files that were already downloaded and 
exist in the destination location.
The tool always won't create a sub-folder in the destination location corresponding the domain name of the URL being a source. 
The tool (by default) will create a sub-folder structure corresponding to the URL's route structure following the domain name. However,
there is an ability to avoid that using [-c] argument.

Here is help info for in-line argument usage:
	[-v: report the version; if this argument is supplied, it aborts execution of the script]
	[-h: help; if this argument is supplied, it aborts execution of the script]
	[-d: debug version]
	[-t target path where to downloaded data will be saved, i.e. /ext_data/stas/ECHO/PM/scrna-seq]
	[-u URL of the source (where from data is being downloaded), i.e. https://wangy33.u.hpc.mssm.edu/10X_Single_Cell_RNA/TD00986_DARAPPilot/
	[-c number of URL's directories (following the main URL part with domain) that should be ignored, i.e. in the URL example provided for '-u' argument, there are 2 directories
	[-m: command that will be used to perfomr the download/copy process.
                - If not provided, the data source (-u parameter) for each entry in the request file will be analyzed to select the appropriate command.
                - expected values are 'wget' or 'cp'].

Usage example: 
./dl_raw_data.sh -t /ext_data/stas/ECHO/PM/scrna-seq -u https://wangy33.u.hpc.mssm.edu/10X_Single_Cell_RNA/TD00986_DARAPPilot -c 2

Log archiver - arch_logs.sh (current version 1.01)
----------------------------------------------
This tool is designed to loop through all created archives and tar all files in the folder that were not archived yet with an exception 
of file(s) listed as exclusion. The idea of this process is to archive all log files except the most recent created log file. 
Here is help info for in-line argument usage:
	[-v: report the version; if this argument is supplied, it aborts execution of the script]
	[-h: help; if this argument is supplied, it aborts execution of the script]
	[-d: debug version]
	[-f path to target folder that will be checked for files to be archived; this is a required parameter
	[-m map of the file names (using shell standards) to select files to be archived in the provided folder, i.e. *.log
	[-e semicolon separated list of files to be excluded from archiving; it will contain file(s) that qualify for the provided map, but have to be excluded, i.e. 20190815_104445.log:20190815_104435.log
